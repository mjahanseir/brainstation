    <h1>Challenge 2: Pseudocode</h1>
    <p>The intended functionality of the program below is to take a list of more than 1000 numbers (not in sequence) and
        determine the biggest number in the list. Identify any error(s) within this pseudocode solution and provide an
        explanation on why you identified this as a potential problem.</p>
    <pre class="code">
1.    Let maxNumber represent the biggest number, set it to zero to start
2.    While there are still numbers left in the list
3.        Look at the next number in the list
4.        Compare it to the maxNumber
5.            If next number is smaller than maxNumber
6.                Set maxNumber to that number
7.    Report maxNumber as the biggest in the list
    </pre>
    <p class="solution"> In line 5(If next number is smaller than maxNumber), it's crucial to clarify that the condition
        should verify whether the next number is "bigger" than maxNumber, not smaller. This distinction is vital because
        our goal is to pinpoint the largest number, updating maxNumber only when encountering a number greater than the
        current maximum. <br>
        <mark>If next number is <em> bigger </em> than maxNumber </mark>
    </p>
